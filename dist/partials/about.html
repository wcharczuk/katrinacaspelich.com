                <p>Hi…I’m Katrina.  Nice to “meet” you.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in southern California, I got my first taste of the fashion industry as a model at the age of 18.  Four years later, I decided to pursue my degree in marketing and love of fashion by moving across country to New York City. The rest is history…</p>
                <p>Let’s fast-forward to present day, where I currently reside as a public relations specialist and content strategist. In the 10 years I’ve been in the fashion industry, I’ve also been fortunate enough to serve as a model agent, casting assistant, and fashion editor. I guess you could say that I’ve had my fair share of dabbling. All in all, my experiences working in these different fields have not only diversified my knowledge of fashion, but they introduced me to many creative people within the industry. I found myself building relationships with PR firms, designers, celebrities, editors and bloggers, from which I learned much and have enjoyed greatly.</p>
                <p>When I’m not writing an article, reorganizing content on an e-commerce site, or pitching a client, I can bee seen scouring the streets for the next big fashion trend or sugary treat. A true fashion aficionado, I live for a good deal and a statement accessory.</p>
